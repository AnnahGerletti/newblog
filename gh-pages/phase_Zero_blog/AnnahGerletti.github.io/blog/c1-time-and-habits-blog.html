                Something that I have found helpful over the years has been to write lists. I have lists for everything and they are everywhere around my flat. Next to my bed, in the kitchen and next to the computer. These help me to focus on what need to be done. <br>

                <br>Until I started reading and apparently lists are “bad” because they set un-accomplishable goals. Not my lists! I tend to write tasks that I am able to get done, then I do a celebratory dance or “woo hoo” and fist pump. As talked about
                in the <em>Fogg Method</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even though I have this list thing down pat, I still have the urge to “get it all done.” With our first set of tickets all I wanted to do was sit and finish them all. This is not conducive to learning, having a social life, or not very good for my wellbeing
                and mental health.<br>

                <br>SO I decided this was one habit I would like to change and I think by implementing the Pomodoro method and being more mindful of what I can take, will help me learn better and make me less stressed. I also found <em>Charles Duhigg – How to create a habit</em>            research so fascinating. I watched many of his videos. I am going to try and implement new good habits and break bad ones. Starting with my typing, I use my middle fingers a lot; so every time I use the wrong finger I will erase and retype
                using the right one.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for mindfulness I enjoy going to the gym. I think yoga and deep breathing can help in calming me down if I am overwhelmed with something. I am very eager to try the yoga class at EDA.
