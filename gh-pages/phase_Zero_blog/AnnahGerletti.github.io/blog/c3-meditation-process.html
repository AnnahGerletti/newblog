          <h3>How did the ‘process over product’ concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild??</h3>

          <p>
          What I took away from the “process over product” concept was create a site that was simple to use, straight forward with not a lot of flair. I feel I created that kind of site with easy to read button and not a lot of text. When I would get hung up on something or feeling like it was so plain I would just remind myself that we are trying to make a responsive site and not a flashy site. I also found this <a href="https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/tree/master/concepts/process-over-product">Emotional booster</a> to be very helpful.
          </p>

          <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading Chapter 2?</h3>

          <p>
          Meditation has always been something that I found intriguing, and I understand that is very beneficial for future mindfulness and old age. I have attempted it a few times, not really feeling any benefits.
          </p>

          <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>

          <p>
          Meditation is excursive for the mind, the key of it is to keep the mind focused on the breath. When the mind drifts pull it back to the breath, it’s this “movement” that works out the brain.
          </p>

          <p>
          Achieving good meditation is making sure that you are relaxed and alert. Accomplishing this is finding a good posture and experimenting with eyes open and closed. When you get distracted or feel discomfort all you need to do it “acknowledge” and then “don’ judge” yourself. The acknowledgement is mindfulness, being aware and lot letting it affect the goal.
          </p>

          <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>

          <p>
          “Breathing like your life depends on it.” Jon Kabat-Zinn<br>
          This gives us an understanding into what meditation is; it’s a state of mind which is fully aware, alert and relaxed.
