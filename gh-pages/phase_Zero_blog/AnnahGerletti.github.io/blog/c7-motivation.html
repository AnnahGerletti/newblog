            <h4>How does life look through the ‘pleasure, passion and purpose’ lens?</h4>
             <p>
               As a late millennial I have a tendency to chase after the pleasure happiness, because this kind of happiness can have instant gratification. Unfortunately, as the book said this type of happiness is not sustainable.
             </p><br>

             <p>
               I have never felt like I had a higher purpose just working day to day. I think gaining happiness with the motivation of a higher purpose would make you feel good about your life. Instead of feeling like you have to accomplish something each and every day. At the moment I do not live like this but would like to work towards a life style where I know the values that are the most meaningful to myself.
             </p><br>

             <p class= "offset-by-three"><strong>I want to find my own higher purpose.</strong></p>


            <h4>From the ‘discover values and higher purpose’ exercise, </h4>
              <h5>What are your core values?</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    My core values are treat others as you would like to be treated and respect the environment. I think it’s very important to be kind to people. Smiling or just saying ‘hello’ can change someone’s day. The environment is not to be taken for granted and it makes me very sad how the human population is treating it.
                  </li>
                </ul>

              <h5>What do you stand for?</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    I don’t know what I stand for. I would say human rights and kindness towards animals. Women’s rights and freedom of speech.
                  </li>
                  <li>How do you know what you truly stand for until you are made to stand up?</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>

              <p>
                I am not very familiar with the three types of resilience, Inner calm, Emotional resilience, and Cognitive resilience. <br> The meditative exercise has an interesting structure, by reviewing a failure and feeling all the emotions that go a long with these thoughts but remembering that they are just physical sensations. Not identifiers to who you are as a person.  Then you wipe that all away by thinking about a success in your life and feel the adjoining emotions. Yet again recognizing that they are just physical sensations.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                In the long run creating the best kind of resilience is through cognitive resilience. Cognitive Resilience lets us understand how we explain our setbacks to ourselves and creating useful mental habits which help us create optimism. Bring optimism to your daily life can be quite challenging because it always seems harder to focus on the good rather than dwelling on the bad. <em>Brenda Fredrikson’s</em> explains this mentality with the 3:1 ratio which states, that It takes three positive feelings to trump one negative one. <br>
                So being truly optimistic takes some mental training but it can be eventually learned.
