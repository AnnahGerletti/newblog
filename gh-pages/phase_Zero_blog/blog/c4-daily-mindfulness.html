      <h3> What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
          <p>
            Having conversations where you are completely focused on the other person and what they are saying can be sometimes challenging for me. I find that I need to be listening but also think about something to say; otherwise you could be left an awkward silence. Nobody likes those.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ‘mindfulness conversation’ is a good goal to have for all conversations. It’s important to be listening to what the other is saying. I also think you can definitely tell when someone is giving you their full attention and it makes you feel good. One of the worst feelings is trying to talk to someone who is on their phone, even though I will admit to doing it from time to time. Being a ‘mindful conversationalist’ is something I will continue to work on.
          </p>

      <h3> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Work with a buddy.</li>
              <li>Do less than you can.</li>
              <li>Take one mindful breath a day.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            I think all three of these are useful in keeping up with the practice but at the moment, I can commit to ‘Taking one mindful breath a day’.
          </p>

      <h3> Any other musings? ?</h3>
          <p>
            The teachings in this book are wonderful and I will try to incorporate more and more into my daily life. Being mindful and aware of your emotions; would be a positive skill to have as a web developer.
