    <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</h4>

      <p>
        The definitions of both mindfulness and self-awareness are very similar in they both promote a steadiness of one’s self while also paying attention to what is happening around you. They share another relationship, which is they are both trainable. One can learn how to be mindful and self-aware.
     </p>

    <h4>
    Try at least one of the self-awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
    </h4>

      <p>
        <strong>Body scan</strong> – is done during meditation, you systemically bring full attention to different parts of the body starting from the top to the bottom. Ending with thinking about a positive emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Journaling</strong> – is the practice of self-discovery by writing to yourself. While targeting yourself you are able to convey thoughts in your head that might not be clear until you get it onto paper. It is important to start the journaling off with a prompt like, “What I am feeling right now…”.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think both of these practices are beneficial and rewarding. During meditation classes I have tried the body scan technique and when I journal I tend to wright down thoughts. While trying meditation using the body scan technique, I felt relaxed and self-aware of my body and how it was feeling. I realised I could feel more muscle soreness during the body scan. This is a good practice if you have a hard time with normal meditation. This can keep you more focused concentrating on a body part.
      </p>

  <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h4>

      <p>
        Removing yourself from your emotions is still very challenging for me. I need to consciously remind myself to say “I am feeling stress in my body” not “I am stressed.” I like the idea that I have power over myself and my emotions. Being able to control the mind and not allowing the little things to be turned into huge disasters, would result in a calmer existence.
