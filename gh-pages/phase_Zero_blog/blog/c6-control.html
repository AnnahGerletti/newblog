        <h4>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h4>
          <p>
            The times that I get really frustrated when I am working through my code happens when I can’t find the answer to a question on google and when I am writing out lines and I have forgotten the necessary punctuation. These situations are triggers and can cause negative thoughts about feelings of inadequacy to come to the surface. The first place I can feel the trigger is my chest, it feels like my heart is beating very fast, and my breath is shallow.
          </p>
          <p>
          The emotional response that goes along with my simple mistakes are very disproportional to the problem but still I will curse or “sigh.” The fact is I should not allow myself to get to this stage and within my practice work more on letting go of those negative feelings.
          </p>

          <p>
            The problem with thinking about the negative thought is you are feeding the monster. By continuing to think about what you did wrong or that you should be meditating, just keeps you down in the dumps longer. Allowing those thoughts and feels to slide away helps you to get over the negative feeling. Trying to start each thought with kindness or humour can also help with turning negatives into positives.
          </p>

        <h4> How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h4>
        <p>This seems like an excellent way to address when triggers occur. Our feelings can be so overwhelming that stopping and recognizing the negative feelings will make us more aware. Trying to pinpoint where the trigger came from and how it affects your body, are important in being able to remove yourself from your emotions. Remember <em>“I am not my emotions!”</em>
