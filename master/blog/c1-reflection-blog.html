             My take on the EDA experience is that you only get out what you put into it. The EDA program motivates you to be a creative mind and pushes you forward to learn at your best ability. The structure of the program is what struck me as very different. It’s based on community learning and helps you to create a foundation before Bootcamp.

              I never thought I would be a coder my family are very artistic and coding was never dinner conversation. Being new to so many things in this culture makes me feel sheepish at times. However, I need to hold my head up know there are no “dumb questions,”
              and accomplish my goals.

              <strong>Practice, Practice, Practice…</strong> I think that’s the most important thing. Just keep coding, keep typing, don’t look at your hand and I will get there. I am looking forward to Partner coding, because it's become apparent that I sometimes
              miss things such as, html tags or brackets. With another pair of eyes more mistakes will be caught before pushing to github.
