          <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>

          <p>
            Trust is very important in all relationships work and personal. It is also very difficult to earn, but once earned the relationship can grow and is much stronger.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are three things I do to build trust, first I listen, second I ask questions and third I provide feedback. I feel I am a good listener and this helps me to build trust within my relationship. Listening is an important technique for establishing trust because people respond positively when they feel they have been heard. Asking probing and open ended questions will also show that you were listening and you are empathetic to their situation. Lastly providing feedback is very important.
          </p>

          <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>

          <p>
            Listening for feelings rather than what they were saying sounds rather challenging. I am still trying to master the mindfulness conversation and truly listen to what the other is “saying.” This is a working progress.
          </p>

          <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>

          <p>
            Being kind makes me feel better, so this type of meditation where you are thinking positively for other bestows a really good feeling. “Creating a mental habit for kindness.”
          </p>

          <h3>The political awareness exercise:</h3>

          <p>
            The situation I have chosen to discuss is something that started happening to me when I moved to New Zealand. It may seem silly to some and not important to others but it still caused me grief. I am talking about the use of the word <span class="orange">“try”</span> or <span class="orange">"taste"</span> at a bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            These words mean two very different things when in USA vs. New Zealand. Sitting at a local Wellington pub with your mates and you ask to <span class="orange">"try"</span> a beer to the Kiwi bartender you have just told them you are committed to drinking a full pint, and this is what you get. When really all you wanted was to have a little sip to decide if it was right for you. Over in the states if you say to an American bartender you would like to <span class="orange">"try"</span> a beer, they provide you with a small portion to try.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interesting thing is I can totally understand how it sounds to a bartender. The use of the verb try means to “give it a go” but to a Kiwi that seems to mean give it a go in a full glass. While the word <span class="orange">"taste"</span> is really saying you would like to have a small portion of the beer before you commit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Either way I think when moving to a new country and in all situations it is important to think about how words and different sayings can be interpreted from the other side of the conversation. I need to really focus on which word I use when I am at the bar ordering a beer.
          </p>

          <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
          <p>Buda says: Whatever one frequently thinks and ponders upon, that will become the inclination of his mind. </p>

          <p>Or – what we think we become.</p>

          <p>
            I found this very interesting because one main thought stood out the most, the people you surround yourself with can have an amazing effect on some peoples’ personalities or emotions. I have witness how surrounding people in your life can either pull you down or lift you up. By changing the way, you think about yourself or your beliefs.
