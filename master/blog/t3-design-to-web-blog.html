        <h3>What is a responsive site, and why is it important?</h3>
        <p>
          Responsive design is creating a website that has the ability to change its size to fit the device the site is opened on. Instead of making the site a specific size the web browser on the device can manipulate the size of site to fit. This is important because the number of people using standard desktops to search the web, has decreased. This design style is still relatively new because it takes a different way of formatting the webpage. However; it will soon become the standard for sites.
        </p>

         <h3>What is mobile first design, and why is it important?</h3>
         <p>
          Out of the widespread population of the world there are 1.2 billon mobile web users, 25% can be found in the U.S. and only access the internet via their cell phones. This has changed the way web designer’s developers approach projects today. However; it’s not the norm yet, because only 25% are mobile-only users while the other 75% brows using larger screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mobile first design is taking a site and thinking about how it should be displayed on a mobile device. This can be challenging because with the limited space and less computing power developers have to decide which features to put on the mobile site. This is important because times are changing and there are more people using smaller devices to access the web. Mobile first design puts the user first.
        </p>

          <h3>What are frameworks, list their pros and cons?</h3>
        <p>
          A framework is a standardized way to write the code needed to create a webpage. It is a downloadable package which containsalready structured files. When a developer uses a framework, their code needs to follow with the same syntax as theframework package.

          <h3>There are many pros and cons to  using frameworks:</h3>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Pros:</th>
              <th>Cons:</th>

        <h3>What are wireframes, and how are they useful?</h3>
        	<p>
            A wireframe is a drawn skeletal lay-or a visual guide to a website. It is useful in helping the designer to visualize what elements they want and how the site will look.
          </p>

        <h3>When designing your wireframe what were some of the difficult aspects, please explain?</h3>
          <p>
            What I found challenging about my wireframe was finding inspiration. I was not quite sure what I wanted my site to looklike. Currently my site looks very different then my original wireframe mock-ups.
