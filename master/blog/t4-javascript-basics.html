      <h3>How does JaveScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>

        <p>
        HTML and CSS are static meaning the code is displayed on the browser and there is no interaction between user and site. Adding JavaScript creates a more dynamic page, such as the user is now able to click buttons or answer questions. The ability of being able to engage with the site is all due to JaveScript, but html and css are still needed for layout and design.

      <h3>Loops and Control Flow explained using examples from everyday life.</h3>

        <p>
        Loops are great, they run blocks of code repeatedly so you don’t have to rewrite it over and over again.<br>
        For example:<br>
        You are listening to your favourite tunes on Spotify and the song changes randomly to a new song, automatically. This is done with a <a>while loop</a>. Pretty much what is happening, is the computer is asking <em>while Spotify is still in play mode, and NOT changed, go and choose new song.</em> Loops are helpful to coder's because they reduce the amount of code needed to be rewritten to complete an action.
        </p>

        <p>
        The control flow is a fancy way of saying how a computer makes decisions. So let’s say you want to play “Choose your own ending” game and the computer asks you a set of questions to determine your path through the game. The control flow can be followed by looking at the use of programing commands called <em>if/else statements.</em> These guys help a computer to make a choice. <strong>If</strong> this happens then do this, or <strong>else</strong> do this.

      <h3>The differences between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>

          <p>
          In common sense terms objects are things which allow associations to be made, an array is a collection of items usually a list. Since arrays are lists that means the computer knows how many things are in the list. If you wanted to know what the third item was in the list you could access the list by using the the number.
          </p>
          <p>
          Objects are little more complicated because objects hold more information. Let’s say you had three people sitting at a table, each have a name, age, and favourite color. You could group them into three different objects. To access the information, you would use the objects name and then specify the piece of information you wanted. For example; <code>person ones.age</code>.
          </p>

       <h3>Why are functions useful?</h3>

          <p>
          In coding it is preferable to write as little code as possible. Enter Functions, these helpful things save coders a lot of time. The beauty of Functions is is that they are reusable code that can be used more than once when its recalled by name.
          </p>
          <p>
          For example,:<br>
          You could save a function which would convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, for those non-metric thinking people. You would name the function <code>thermostat</code>, and you wanted to know what 20 degrees was in fahrenheit. So you would call the function <code>thermostat(20)</code> and out would pop 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Isn’t that neat?
