          <p>
            Through-out my life I have faced many challenges, using different techniques of problem solving to work them out. Since moving into my new apartment I have been facing a daily problem until recently.
          </p>
            <p>
              By my bed sits a little table that rests my night ritual amenities and my phone. This table does not sit flat against the wall, allowing there to be a space. Constantly things fall behind the table, which have to be retrieved.
            </p>
            <p>
              Solving this problem was very easy, all I did was attach a board to the back of table preventing items from falling. The idea for this came from looking at a box, which turned out to be the inspiration I needed to fix the problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              When solving this problem, I learned that all it took was some inspiration. Being creative when solving problems is a key element in becoming a good coder. Getting ideas for solving problems can come from talking to fellow co-workers, research or just looking at examples and being inspired.
            </p>

              <span><h5>9 good problem solving methods.</h5></span>
              <ul>
              	<li>Pseudocode</li>
              	<li>Trying Something</li>
              	<li>Rubber Ducky Method</li>
              	<li>Reading Error Messages</li>
              	<li>console.loging</li>
              	<li>Googling</li>
              	<li>Asking your peers for help</li>
              	<li>Asking coaches for help</li>
              	<li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
            <p>
              Many of these techniques are useful in solving problems. The methods I have used the most are Googling, Rubber Ducky and talking to peers. As I learn it seems talking to people and saying the code out load is very helpful.

        <h3>Tech explained in a Non-Tech way!</h3>
        <div class="u-full-width objectArray">
          <span>
            One of the easiest ways to group information together while coding is forming an object, which is a group of variables/values. But what do you do if you have several objects which are all pretty similar? You can put them into a list or <strong>object array.</strong></span><br>
          <span>
            Now that you have your object array you can perform different action to the specific groups or to the whole list of grouped objects. <strong>For example:</strong> there is an action called <code>.push</code> which will added another object to the end of your list.
          </span><br>
          <span>Here are some more examples of array methods.</span>
        </div>


<hr>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="u-full-width arrayMethods">
              <h4>callback</h4>
              <span>These three array methods all invoke the <code>callback</code>function</span>
              <p>
                Rather than programmatically going through an array (eg. for loop) you can use methods inherited by an array to pass the values as parameters to a function. This type approach is called a <code>callback</code>.
              </p>
        </div>

<hr>
        <div class="row">
          <h4>.map</h4>
          <p>
            The method <code>.map</code> when applied to an array creates a new array with a new object name. It takes each element from the array and runs it through a provided function, which results in a new array.
          </p>
        </div>

<hr>
        <div class="row">
          <h4>.filter</h4>
          <p>
            The method <code>.filter</code> passes each value in the array to a function, which decides whether to filter out the value based on the logic within the function.
          </p>
        </div>

<hr>
        <div class="row">
          <h4>.reduce</h4>
          <p>
            The method <code>.reduce</code> reduces the individual values of an array to a single total number.
          </p>
        </div>

<hr>
        <h4>Example Syntax</h4>
<pre><code>var myArray = [1,2,3,4];
function myFunction (value){
  return value; //add logic to filter/map/reduce here
}
var newArray = myArray.filter(myFunction);
</code></pre>
